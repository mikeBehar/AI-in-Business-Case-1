## Case Overview

This is **Case Study 1** for the AI in Business course, focusing on algorithmic bias and fairness in AI-powered lending decisions.

**Scenario**: Liberty Regional Bank, a community bank in Bridgeport, CT, must decide whether to deploy an AI loan screening system that shows disparate impact across racial groups. The board faces ethical, legal, financial, and competitive considerations with no clearly "right" answer.

**Key Decision**: Should Liberty Regional deploy the AI system as-is, delay for fixes, abandon it entirely, or pursue alternative approaches?

1. Read [case-study.md](case-study.md) carefully - note specific numbers and stakeholder arguments
2. Complete assignments in [blackboard-assignments.md](blackboard-assignments.md)
