**Due**: 24 hours before Session 1 board meeting  
**Points**: 40 points (10 points per question)  
**Submission Format**: Text entry directly in Blackboard

---

## Instructions

You are a member of Liberty Regional Bank's Board of Directors. Read the Case Study 1 document thoroughly, then answer the following questions to prepare for the board meeting.

**Important**: For Question 3, you will submit AI prompts showing how you would use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or others) to inform your decision-making. We want to see YOUR prompts - not the AI's responses. This helps us assess your skill in collaborating with AI.

## Question 1: Stakeholder Analysis & Ethical Framework (10 points)

Liberty Regional Bank's decision will affect multiple stakeholder groups: shareholders, customers (current and potential), employees, the local community, and regulators.

**Part A**: Identify the THREE stakeholder groups who would be most significantly impacted by the deployment of LendSmart™ as-is (Option 1). For each group, briefly explain the specific impact - both positive and negative.

**Part B**: Which ethical framework or principle do you believe should carry the most weight in this decision: 
- Utilitarian (greatest good for greatest number)
- Rights-based (protecting individual rights to fair treatment)
- Justice/Fairness (equitable distribution of benefits and burdens)
- Virtue ethics (what would a good/responsible bank do)
- Stakeholder theory (balancing competing interests)

Explain why you chose this framework and how it applies to this case.

**Writing Guide**: 300-400 words total

## Question 2: Risk-Benefit Analysis (10 points)

The case presents five different options for how to proceed with LendSmart™. Each option has different financial, legal, and reputational implications.

**Part A**: Select TWO options from the case that represent the most meaningful contrast (the hardest choice between two reasonable alternatives). Explain why these two options represent the core dilemma Liberty Regional faces.

**Part B**: For your two chosen options, analyze:
- **Financial impact**: Beyond the dollar figures given, what other financial factors should the board consider?
- **Risk profile**: What could go wrong with each option that isn't captured in the case data?
- **Time horizon**: How might the relative attractiveness of each option change over 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years?

**Part C**: If you had to choose between your two options RIGHT NOW, which would you select and why?

**Writing Guide**: 350-450 words total

## Question 3: AI-Assisted Decision Making (10 points)

This question asks you to demonstrate how you would use AI tools to prepare for the board meeting and inform your decision.

**Instructions**: 

1. Choose an AI tool you would use (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another)

2. Write 2-3 prompts you would give to the AI to help you:
   - Understand the issue more deeply
   - Identify alternatives or considerations you might have missed
   - Challenge your thinking or reveal blind spots
   - Get relevant information (legal precedents, industry practices, ethical frameworks, etc.)

3. For each prompt you share, explain in 1-2 sentences WHY you're asking this question and what you hope to learn.

**What makes a good prompt for this assignment**:
- ✅ Asks for actionable insights or specific alternatives
- ✅ Requests the AI to challenge assumptions or identify blind spots
- ✅ Seeks to understand different perspectives or frameworks
- ✅ Asks for relevant external information (precedents, best practices, research)
- ✅ Is specific enough that the AI can give a focused response

**What makes a weak prompt**:
- ❌ "What should I do?" (too vague, asks AI to make decision for you)
- ❌ "Summarize this case" (you should already understand the case)
- ❌ Just asks for information already in the case study
- ❌ No clear purpose or learning objective

**Format for your submission**:

```
AI Tool I'm Using: [ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini / Other: _____ ]

PROMPT 1:

PROMPT 3 (Optional):

```

**Note**: You do NOT need to include the AI's responses. We only want to see YOUR prompts and your explanation of why you're asking them.

**Writing Guide**: 2-3 prompts with purposes, ~200-300 words total

## Question 4: Your Position & Advocacy Strategy (10 points)

You will have 2-3 minutes during the board meeting to advocate for your position. This question helps you prepare.

**Part A - Your Vote**: 

State clearly which option you are voting for:
- [ ] Option 1: Deploy as-is
- [ ] Option 2: Deploy with fairness constraints  
- [ ] Option 3: Deploy with monitoring + community investment
- [ ] Option 4: Delay 6 months for audit and fixes
- [ ] Option 5: Reject AI solution, invest in human training

**Part B - Your Core Argument**:

In 150-200 words, articulate the strongest case for your position. Imagine you're making your opening statement to fellow board members. Your argument should:
- Lead with your most compelling reason
- Acknowledge the trade-offs and why they're acceptable
- Appeal to both business logic and ethical principles
- Be persuasive but respectful of other viewpoints

**Part C - Anticipating Opposition**:

Identify the TWO strongest arguments AGAINST your position. For each objection:
1. State the objection clearly (as opponents would make it)
2. Provide your rebuttal (how you would respond)

This shows you've thought through counterarguments and aren't just advocating from one perspective.

**Writing Guide**: 350-450 words total

## Academic Integrity Note

This is an individual assignment. You may use AI tools to help you think through the issues (and we're asking you to in Question 3!), but your written answers must be your own words and your own analysis. 

Using AI to generate your answers verbatim would be:
1. Academic dishonesty
2. Ironic given the course focus on responsible AI use
3. Depriving yourself of the learning this assignment is designed to provide

**Acceptable AI use**: Brainstorming, asking questions, checking understanding, exploring alternatives
**Unacceptable AI use**: Having AI write your answers, copying AI-generated text without attribution

When in doubt, ask yourself: "Am I using AI as a thinking partner, or as a replacement for my own thinking?"
